Create a new React application called jubebox-react in this directory

This will be a web application that lists songs sorted by artist and album and allows the user to 
add those songs to a queue to be played.

The business logic is accessed via a REST API described using Swagger at http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html

The first screen should show a list of artists sorted alphabetically. A vertical scrollbar should be used 
to navigate the list. 

When an artist is clicked, the screen should show a list of albums for that artist sorted alphabetically. 
A vertical scrollbar should be used to navigate the list. 

When an album is clicked, the screen should show a list of songs for that album sorted alphabetically. 
A vertical scrollbar should be used to navigate the list. 

All vertical scrollbars should have tooltip showing the first letter of the current item in the list to allow for rapid scrolling.

When a song is clicked, the song should be added to the queue. The queue should be displayed in a 
separate page of the application reached via a top menu. The queue should show the current song
being played, followed by a scrollable list of upcoming songs.
